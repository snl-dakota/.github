# Contributing to Dakota

## Help Users

Help out a fellow Dakota user by participating in the [Dakota Discussion Forum](https://github.com/orgs/snl-dakota/discussions).

Contribute to the [Examples Library](https://github.com/snl-dakota/dakota). For example, demonstrate a new kind of Dakota input configuration, show how to interface Dakota to a simulation code, or share a case study.

Improve the [User Guide](https://dakota.sandia.gov/sites/default/files/docs/6.17.0-release/user-html/), by editing [`dakota/docs`](https://github.com/snl-dakota/dakota/tree/devel/docs).

## Author Code

Fix a bug, tweak a feature. Dakota can review and accept small patches and bug fixes to any of its components.

We're still setting up a process to accept major contributions. Start a [Dakota Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/snl-dakota/discussions) or email  dakota@sandia.gov if you'd like to propose a more substantial collaboration.

## Contribution Mechanics

For contributions to any of Dakota's repositories, use the typical GitHub [Fork and Pull Request Model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models).
